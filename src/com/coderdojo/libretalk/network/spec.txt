Libretalk Network Specifications.
--------------------------------

Each user has their own unique Queue on the server - all queues are named according to the following
scheme:

    libretalk.user.<user ID>
    
Where <user ID> is a long integer. Possible values for this field include a unique and permanent ID 
assigned at registration (would require a database/website setup), a Java UUID (not permanent, random)
or a SHA-1 (or similar) hash of the client's username. I recommend this option, as it allows for unique
values. Also clients would be able to identify their friends' queues from their usernames.

Sent messages go to one of two exchanges on the server:

    libretalk.chat.peers
    libretalk.chat.global (not yet implemented!)
    
 libretalk.chat.peers is a "direct" exchange, which means it will route messages to a specific queue based
 on a routing key. For routing keys, I've chosen to simply go with the user's queue name.
 
 libretalk.chat.global is a "fanout" exhange, which means it will ignore routing keys and simply send
 the message to all queues bound to the exchange.
